# Gauss-Legendre DE Solver
A Python implementation of the Gauss-Legendre method for solving differential equations (DE) with high precision, featuring applications to energy-conserving systems.

## Features
- **High Precision Calculations**: Uses `np.float128` for numerical stability.  
- **Energy Analysis**: Tracks and visualizes energy conservation throughout the simulation.  
- **Customizable and Extendable**: Easily adaptable to other ODE systems.  

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run one of the example scripts.

## Contributing
